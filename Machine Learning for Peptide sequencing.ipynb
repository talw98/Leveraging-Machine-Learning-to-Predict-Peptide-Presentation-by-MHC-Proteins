    "## TASK DESCRIPTION\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem revolves around the fact whether a particular peptide sequence will be presented by a specific MHC class I (MHC1) protein, denoted by its allele name. MHC proteins have the ability to display peptides, which are short chains of amino acids, on the surface of cells. By providing T cells with peptides, MHC1 proteins play a critical function in the immune system by allowing the immune system to keep an eye on cells for indications of infection or aberrant activity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Because of genetic variants in the MHC1 genes, or alleles, each person has a distinct collection of MHC1 proteins. Individual differences in MHC1 proteins enable the immune system to identify a broad spectrum of possible dangers, such as infections and cancerous cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding immune responses and creating immunotherapies, especially for the treatment of cancer, depend on identifying the precise peptides that MHC proteins present. Treatments that are less harmful and more successful can be achieved by focusing on particular peptides that are provided by MHC1 proteins. This will assist activate the immune system to identify and destroy cancer cells while preserving healthy cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## OBJECTIVE\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective is to build a predictive model that can accurately determine whether a given peptide sequence will be presented by a specific MHC1 protein, based on its allele name. The model will be trained on the dataset containing peptide sequences, corresponding allele names, and binary labels indicating peptide presentation i.e., '1' if the peptide is present and '0' for else.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ultimate goal is to develop a robust classifier that can assist in identifying peptides with potential immunogenic properties, facilitating the discovery and development of novel immunotherapies for various diseases, including cancer.\n"

    "The Jupyter Notebook for this task is divided into 4 sections, each section containing the code and descriptions to reach the intended goal of the task. The Four sections of this notebook are:\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. DATASET ANALYSIS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section delves into exploring the dataset, examining its characteristics, and uncovering potential issues. It includes an analysis of key statistics such as the distribution of target variables, alleles, and peptide lengths. Additionally, missing values are checked to ensure data integrity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. METHOD EXPLANATION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the methods employed in the approach of this task are explained. Random Forest Classifier, a robust ensemble learning algorithm, is described and explained, as well as the concept of one-hot encoding for peptide sequences and alleles, a technique crucial for representing categorical data in machine learning models. References are also provided in this section as required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. EXPERIMENT DESCRIPTION:**\n",
    "\n",
    "This section outlines experimental approach to showcase the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The process of training Random Forest Classifier using one hot encoded sequences of peptides and alleles are explained .\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. RESULT ANALYSIS:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the final section, outcomes of the experiments are analysed. The model's performance metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, on both training and test sets are scrutinized. Furthermore, a confusion matrix is made to gain insights into the model's predictive capabilities and potential areas for enhancement. In the end, recommendations are given for further imrpoving the model with references.\n",

    "   - The average peptide length is approximately 10.83 amino acids.\n",
    "   - The standard deviation is about 1.97, indicating the spread of peptide lengths around the mean.\n",
    "   - Peptide lengths range from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 15 amino acids.\n",
    "   - The median peptide length (50th percentile) is 11 amino acids, indicating that half of the peptides have a length of 11 or less, while the other half have a length of 11 or more.\n",
    "   - The interquartile range (IQR), which represents the range of values between the 25th and 75th percentiles, is from 9 to 13 amino acids.\n",

    "## 2. METHOD EXPLANATION\n",
    "\n",
    "In this task, RANDOM FOREST CLASSIFIER (`RandomForestClassifier`) will be used as the algorithm to train and make predictions. Furthermore, a technique called 'One Hot Encoding' will be used to tranform the non numeric values of the 'peptide' and 'allele' columns into numeric ones so that the Random Forest Classifier can make predictions. Following are the detailed explanations of the methods (One Hot Encoding and Random Forest Classifier):\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **One-Hot Encoding**:\n",
    "   - One-hot encoding is a technique used to convert categorical variables into a numerical format that machine learning algorithms can understand.\n",
    "   - It represents each category as a binary vector where only one element is \"hot\" (set to 1) while the others are \"cold\" (set to 0).\n",
    "   - For example, consider the following amino acids in a peptide sequence: \"ACDEFG\". Each amino acid can be represented as a binary vector:\n",
    "     - \"A\": [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "     - \"C\": [0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "     - \"D\": [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]\n",
    "     - and so on...\n",
    "   - This encoding preserves the categorical nature of the variables while providing numerical features that can be used by machine learning algorithms.\n",
    "   \n",
    "\n",
    "2. **One-hot Encoding for Peptide Sequences and Alleles**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Peptide sequences and alleles are categorical variables that need to be converted into a numerical format for machine     learning algorithms.\n",
    "   - One-hot encoding is used to represent each amino acid in a peptide sequence and each allele as a binary vector.\n",
    "   - For peptide sequences, each amino acid is represented by a binary vector where only one element is \"hot\" (set to 1) while the others are \"cold\" (set to 0). This preserves the categorical nature of the amino acids while providing numerical features.\n",
    "   - Similarly, the alleles are encoded using one-hot encoding, where each unique allele is represented by a binary vector.\n",
    "   - Both the one-hot encoded peptide sequences and alleles are concatenated together to form the final feature matrix used for training the Random Forest Classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Random Forest Classifier**:\n",
    "   - Random Forest Classifier is an ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.\n",
    "   - It builds multiple decision trees during training and merges their predictions to improve the overall accuracy and robustness of the model.\n",
    "   - Each decision tree in the random forest is trained on a random subset of the training data and a random subset of features.\n",
    "   - Random Forest Classifier is known for its ability to handle high-dimensional feature spaces, non-linear relationships, and noisy data.\n",
    "   - It's less prone to overfitting compared to individual decision trees and tends to generalize well to unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Why Random Forest Classifier is Used**:\n",
    "   \n",
    "   In this specific case of predicting peptide presentation by MHC class I proteins, Random Forest Classifier is chosen for several reasons:\n",
    "     - It's effective in handling classification tasks where there are complex relationships between features and the target variable.\n",
    "     - Peptide sequences and alleles are categorical variables that require careful handling, and Random Forest Classifier can effectively learn from such data.\n",
    "     - The problem involves predicting whether a peptide will be presented by a specific MHC class I protein, which may involve non-linear relationships and interactions between peptide sequences and alleles.\n",
    "     - Random Forest Classifier can handle such complexities and provide reliable predictions even in the presence of noise and high-dimensional feature spaces.\n",
    "     - In the code afterwards where the Random Forest Classifier is trained, the code instantiates a Random Forest Classifier with 100 trees (`n_estimators=100`) and sets the random state for reproducibility (`random_state=42`). Furthermore, `class_weight` is adjusted to '`balanced`' to address the class imbalance of the target variable.\n",

Train-test split wasn't used because the dataset was already available in five folds, which was concatenated above, and ultimately will be used for cross-validation afterwards. The five folds provided ample data for training and validation, eliminating the need for an additional train-test split. Using the five folds ensures that the model is trained and evaluated across various subsets of the data, leading to more robust performance evaluation and model generalization. "

    "\n",
    "The confusion matrix provides a detailed breakdown of the model's predictions compared to the actual labels in the test dataset. In the context of the task, the confusion matrix reveals the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **True Negatives (TN)**: The classifier correctly predicted 900,099 instances where peptides were not presented (class 0).\n",
    "- **False Positives (FP)**: The classifier incorrectly predicted 626 instances as presented peptides (class 1) when they were not.\n",
    "- **False Negatives (FN)**: The classifier incorrectly predicted 43,673 instances as non-presented peptides (class 0) when they were actually presented peptides (class 1).\n",
    "- **True Positives (TP)**: The classifier correctly predicted 1,743 instances where peptides were presented (class 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "These values indicate the classifier's performance in distinguishing between presented and non-presented peptides. In particular:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The high number of true negatives (900,099) suggests that the classifier is effective at identifying non-presented peptides.\n",
    "- However, the presence of false positives (626) and false negatives (43,673) indicates areas where the classifier may be making errors in its predictions.\n",
    "- The number of true positives (1,743) represents the instances where the classifier correctly identified presented peptides.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarise, while the classifier demonstrates reasonable performance in some aspects, there are areas where it can be improved, particularly in reducing false positives and false negatives to enhance its predictive accuracy and reliability in peptide presentation prediction.\n",

    "To enhance the performance of the Random Forest Classifier in predicting peptide presentation by MHC proteins, I recommend to employ various strategies customised to the specifics of the task and the dataset used here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Addressing Class Imbalance**:\n",
    "   - Given the imbalance between presented (class 1) and non-presented (class 0) peptides, it is crucial to minimize this imbalance to prevent the classifier from being biased towards the majority class. Techniques like oversampling using Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique (SMOTE) or adjusting class weights during model training can help address this issue (Chawla et al., 2002).\n",

    "   - Additional features derived from peptide sequences or biological knowledge can be explored that can better capture the underlying patterns associated with peptide presentation. This may involve considering physiochemical properties of amino acids or structural motifs relevant to MHC binding (Nielsen et al., 2017).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Advanced Techniques**:\n",
    "   - We can use Deep Learning architectures, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), to automatically learn hierarchical representations from peptide sequences and capture intricate dependencies (Alipanahi et al., 2015).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By iteratively applying these strategies and incorporating domain-specific knowledge, we can develop a more robust and accurate classifier for predicting peptide presentation by MHC proteins.\n",
